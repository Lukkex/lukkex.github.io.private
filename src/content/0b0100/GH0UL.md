Name: Ghoul

Initial title: Aeon of Ego

Post-awoken title: Aeon of Interconnection

Class: Sygilist

Description: Sygils drawn out or motioned with one’s limbs grants the user essentially a placebo towards whatever they label that sigil does (or were told it does), manifesting it within their own Psykhe and thus in the noösphere

Personality progression: Ghoul has never known a life not built around their own narcissism; from youth til the present, they have never grown beyond such ways - different from Dahzurael, Ghoul is egotistical on divine knowledge including their sygil skills in the present moment rather than mania fueling some prophecy or guarantee in life as if you’re “the chosen one” built on fear of the unknown and used to justify hatred, this is why Ghoul is the aeon of Ego for they think their knowledge makes them better than everyone and they don’t need anyone else (isolation and loneliness as well comes with this, overcoming this leads them to embrace interconnection, becoming the aeon of interconnection - they go from cruel, trying to make a sub realm where they’ll survive the ultimatum alone and let all else die, to instead realizing we are all one, they could’ve been born as anyone else and might be reborn as all else after each life for all they know, and come to open up with time instead of shutting off others bc they think they don’t need anyone to help them; they slowly allow themself to be helped, and become stronger because of it), and Dahzurael is the aeon of Hatred - they both are rooted in ego / narcissism, but Ghoul’s is pure ego WITH/BECAUSE of wisdom whilst Dahzurael is narcissism because of ignorance

Vice: Ghoul’s self of Ego fuels their every move, especially in their Sygilism Arts; it actively puts others down, draining them of motivation and self esteem, or on the contrary for others, makes them competitive in nature to beat ghoul, thus they become hyper egotistical more and more over time which just allows ghoul to feed off their ego, compete against them and fuel their own ego more and more over time, whilst simultaneously corrupting the person w/ ego, now acting more alone and separating themself from friends and loved ones because they “don’t need them” - of course, the true pacifist route requires the aeons of change to choose a path between these two vices / transient beyond the dichotomy, and be resilient not out of competitiveness and thus ego, but instead, righteousness and thus also the opposite of ego, selflessness & boosting interconnection, which shall ultimately be the cause that leads to Ghoul reaching their own post-awoken state through understanding
