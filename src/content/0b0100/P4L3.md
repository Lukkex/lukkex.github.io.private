Personality progression: Pale is consistently inconsistent throughout the game; but, overall, helping the aeons of change with some questionable quirks along the way

Vice: Unknown what their main vice is or if they have one, but they can “Blink”; able to make screens, windows of sorts into other realms or sub realms, watching… viewing…. These can be used to travel quickly from place to place, seemingly creating wormholes through the noösphere
