Name: Venn

Initial title: Aeon of Agony

Post-awoken title: Aeon of Healing

Class: Wordsmage / Word Witch

Description: Words are parasitic, subliminal messaging, altering the noösphere, influencing minds when uttered and once heard by the other (inspired by MGS & @n…); once used for goodness, to help others heal, now, after the loss of their partner, scream in agony out of pain and heartbreak to the sky, echoing across their previous realm and now the new realm as well, uttering words that wish for the heartbreak of others, for ppl’s relationships to crumble as did theirs, and so on

Personality progression: Venn once was light hearted and loving, outgoing, creative, and wanting to help everyone; the loss of their fiance due to a catastrophic sequence of events and continued heartbreak trying to find them in other people (and losing them too) has turned Venn to be cold blooded, heartless, angry and heartbroken beyond belief at what happened and what they still cannot accept has happened, stuck yearning for what is gone, stuck drowning in tears

Vice (prime aeon “power,” but what also corrupts/imbalances them): Words of agony, loss, pain; they deal emotional/psychological damage to the player, slowly driving them into a deeper pit of sorrow until they wind up just like Venn; unable to move on from the pain, stuck in the past of their regrets - ofc, takes away actual “HP,” but I prob will name HP something else more fitting in the game, probably something like VIRTUE
(Similar to undertale with the whole DETERMINATION thing but much more specific; virtue is used in the same way as Aristotle does with his virtue ethics, aka, a balanced way of moving forward, so basically determination AND critical thought each step of the way, calculated progression towards a united wonderful future, as is the whole goal/point of the story)
