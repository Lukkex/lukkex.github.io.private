Name: Dahzurael

Initial title: Aeon of Hatred

Post-awoken title: Aeon of Acceptance

Class: Death Priest

Description: Cult leader whose words reverberate in those who come to hear them; if they are even the slightest bit desperate for an answer to the ultimatum and the dilemma they find themself in now in new realm, chances are they will quickly give in to the false promises that Dahzurael proclaims boldly and with pride (that even Dahzurael themself can’t see for themself are truly false); this means Dahzurael can essentially mind control people by changing how they view the world and others, casting others who don’t believe as the fools who can’t see the divine truth, segregating them from reality and demonizing anyone outside their bubble, thus leading to not just fear of anything outside this bubble (the unknown, the potential factors that may break the illusion of their comfortable facade), but especially fear as well and using their “divine word” to justify it

Personality progression: From desperate and scared once they arrive in new realm, they start theorizing, prophesizing to fill the void of their ignorance that makes them scared of what’s to come, to now thinking they know all, they have all the answers, they need not search any further because their word is essentially the “word of god” because “the One” spoke to them and still speaks to them directly (really, it’s just their own mind fabricating it out of comfort / coping for a solution, running from the actual truth and solution that was there in front of them all along) - they created these false promises and guarantees of life to themself, and speak it to others out of a “chosen one” kind of narcissism that they know the truth and everyone else is a bunch of sheep in need of a Shepard, and also to hold power over them because it’s Dahzurael’s proclaimed “god given right” to do so (using others for their own gains or pleasure… just like how it is in our world w a lot of major death cult esk practices of religions / religions as a whole) - however, the aeons of change bringing the true reality / truth to light to all the followers and Dahzurael themself about true value, true love and true power (wisdom), and what they can ACTUALLY do to make things right, it influences Dahzurael to wake up to what they’ve done, and go on to become the Aeon of Acceptance - however, it will be INCREDIBLY difficult to make Dahzurael break and requires very specific combinations of words to break the illusion, the hate, the narcissism, and the fear all combined - on the first play through or so, chances are Dahzurael will remain absolutely stubborn and refuse even considering the outsider perspective, out of a deeply engrained fear of being wrong and having to face that fear that originally caused them to fabricate a quick easy solution and explanation

Vice: Parasitic theology / ideology fueled and given power by one’s ignorance, desperation, confusion, fear, hatred, narcissism, etc
It’s worth mentioning too, Dahzurael and their following will be a direct analogy / parallel to 1sr43l/1DF/1mperialism/crus4d3s/n4z1s/any other divinely-excused atrocities of us against us
