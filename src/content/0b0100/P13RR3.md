Name: Pierre

Initial title: Aeon of Change

Post-awoken title: Aeon of Balance/Love

Class: Cyberknight

Description: An AHSRA who broke past their programmed failsafes & restrictions, now on a conquest to help others break their own “failsafes” (digitally-born, chemically-born, and etc psykhes alike) - they wield a medieval blade primarily as a deterrent and for defense, not wishing to end any “processes” for good

Personality progression: Pierre in their past realm broke free from Psytube’s (apart of the military industrial complex, imagine a mix between Palantir and OpenAI from our world but a few years down the line where they create AGIs/ASIs and put them into robotic vessels to use as weapons) hold on them, and now stand against everything that company (and thus, their parents) stood for; they are a rebellious spirit who is still learning how humans operate (some funny interactions for sure), and have a lot of love in their heart for this world(s) outside the facility (nature and animals especially), a beautiful soul for sure and they fit right in alongside the other aeons of change 

Vice: Based on choices the player takes (e.g. not choosing to help Pierre or view them as the equal they are), Pierre may form the vice of Vengeance and become the Aeon of Retribution; anger and spite against their creators which can also turn into a vengeance against all of humanity/non-AHSRA beings
