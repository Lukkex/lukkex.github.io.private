Although I believe there to be blatant core shared identities and archetypes and some truths in all religions (and open-mindedly find balance / find “God” through myself and my own logic as all people should rather than from the mouths of others), I most definitely resonate with Buddhism out of them all; to have the Self, the conscious unconscious and dream state all united and to climb above and beyond Illusion, to reach the point of Absolute, AKA the highest possible mental state that you can reach, because it’s not about finding out the secrets of the universe, because ignorance is the greatest gift of all and what makes us allow to subjectively perceive everything to begin with, to be us, to be stupid humans, and that’s a fantastic thing. Thus, since “all we may ever know is that we truly know nothing,” the best possible path you likely can take is through utmost acceptance, peace with oneself and all, acknowledging the clear interconnection between us and everything within this universe and beyond, and simply being. There’s so much more I could say, but I believe you get the point.

- 6/26/2023, sent to someone over instagram in conversation in regards to ideas of Ted Kac, “Technology is the answer, but what was the question?” We never needed tech [yet, is another emergence of the natural flow of change and potential becoming manifested inevitably given enough time].
