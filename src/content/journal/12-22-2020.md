GaleToday at 10:06 PM

[
10:06 PM
]
I’m past that

0xToday at 10:06 PM
same here
[
10:07 PM
]
people who are truly racist are inconsiderate and ignorant in train of thought
[
10:07 PM
]
skin pigments have cause so many wars it ridiculous

GaleToday at 10:07 PM
I’ve never said it as an offense to offend a black person before and I never will

0xToday at 10:07 PM
because our biology has practically instilled it into us that being powerful over another person is better
[
10:07 PM
]
and it feels good
[
10:07 PM
]
and racism is just that

GaleToday at 10:07 PM
Fr slavery was horrid
[
10:08 PM
]
I’ve been called a lot of things before cause I’m Asian

0xToday at 10:08 PM
ive been called a cracker and a jew and a thousand other things before too [ofc, i am privileged asf being a white person compared to other ethnicities within the USA, something i did know of but didnt fully recognize to what scale back when this convo happened in hs, but do understand deeply now - 8/13/2025]

GaleToday at 10:08 PM
I personally just don’t care abt the slurs, they can keep making jokes idc

0xToday at 10:08 PM
and im sure everyone has been or will be called a racial slur at some point in their life
[
10:09 PM
]
its just another one of the resulting cruelties of humanity's ignorance and selfishness
[
10:09 PM
]
the only thing wrong with this planet is the people on it

GaleToday at 10:09 PM
Racism is just bashing another race just to feel good
[
10:09 PM
]
Like nobody gains anything from racism, only losses

0xToday at 10:09 PM
racism is just savagery
[
10:10 PM
]
primitive instincts turned sinister

GaleToday at 10:10 PM
Skin color does not create inferiority idk why that became a thing
[
10:11 PM
]
No matter what, races will be racist to other races

0xToday at 10:11 PM
humankind made it become an inferiority

GaleToday at 10:11 PM
It’s become unstoppable

0xToday at 10:11 PM
our natural "us against them" thought process

GaleToday at 10:12 PM
We hate tyrannical leaders yet act like tyrants to minorities
[
10:12 PM
]
“We” as in humanity

0xToday at 10:12 PM
exactly
[
10:12 PM
]
because tyrannical leaders have power over us
[
10:12 PM
]
and that means a loss of power on our side

GaleToday at 10:12 PM
And humans love power

0xToday at 10:12 PM
and as humans, we adore power

GaleToday at 10:12 PM
Power changes a man

0xToday at 10:12 PM
exactly
[
10:13 PM
]
power means were higher up on the podium

GaleToday at 10:13 PM
Power can completely change a person and their actions, it’s sad
[
10:13 PM
]
Zero humbleness

0xToday at 10:13 PM
and humanity has always strived to become greater

GaleToday at 10:13 PM
Only arrogance

0xToday at 10:13 PM
and thats why were where were at today
[
10:13 PM
]
"above" other animals
[
10:13 PM
]
"above" nature
[
10:13 PM
]
and because of that ideology
[
10:14 PM
]
we'll inevitably crumble our foundations
[
10:14 PM
]
and fall with them

GaleToday at 10:14 PM
Racism has taken plenty of lives before and still is, a death with the base of racism is us hurting ourselves
[
10:14 PM
]
Nobody gains anything
[
10:14 PM
]
We all just become savages

0xToday at 10:15 PM
we've been hurting ourselves for a long time as a species
[
10:15 PM
]
and will continue to do so
[
10:15 PM
]
most likely

GaleToday at 10:15 PM
For real, we’ve done too much damage in my opinion

0xToday at 10:16 PM
until we change our ideology
[
10:16 PM
]
we're the only species on this planet that has ever done any true damage to our world(edited)

GaleToday at 10:16 PM
Racism is technically passed down, it’s inevitable
[
10:16 PM
]
Yeah that’s true
[
10:17 PM
]
I never intended to be racist but I’m sure everyone has been racist in their lives in some way

0xToday at 10:17 PM
Monsters don't hide under beds, they sleep in them.(edited)
[
10:17 PM
]
Native americans honestly had the perfect ideology when it came to animals and nature
[
10:18 PM
]
live alongside them without disturbing them
[
10:18 PM
]
while still growing
[
10:18 PM
]
you dont need to destroy nature and manipulate animals to achieve more and grow higher
[
10:18 PM
]
but since we love power
[
10:18 PM
]
we've done just that

GaleToday at 10:19 PM
once you get power its hard to not want more of it
[
10:19 PM
]
you cant stop, that leads to supremacy
[
10:19 PM
]
which leads to others being oppressed
[
10:20 PM
]
some people are just ignorant as fuck
[
10:20 PM
]
if we never change, racism will live for as long as humans live

0xToday at 10:20 PM
yep
[
10:21 PM
]
and i know this may sound sinister
[
10:21 PM
]
but as i see it, the only way humans will ever end this ideology is if humans practically end altogether
[
10:21 PM
]
or if you get rid of all the humans with that ideology [i do NOT view it like this anymore, there was a third option i couldn't see back then; show by example the best way to be, that is, as unconditionally loving, kind, empathetic as you possibly can for everyone, especially to those who hate you most - 8/13/2025]
[
10:22 PM
]
and plant a new seed in the base of our species
[
10:22 PM
]
obviously, i dont wanna kill anybody ever

GaleToday at 10:22 PM
you have a point

0xToday at 10:22 PM
but in my opinion, thats the only way i see us elimating racism for good
[
10:23 PM
]
well, not for good
[
10:23 PM
]
eventually, that same racist ideology will rise up once again
[
10:23 PM
]
all ideologies inevitably come to be if you give it enough time
[
10:24 PM
]
ideas sprout from our conscious, which is wired by biology
[
10:25 PM
]
and until we eliminate our flaws, we will always have those same primitive desired locked away within our minds
[
10:25 PM
]
the craving of power - to become higher than another, to have a higher chance of survival which is truly the main goal of our brains
[
10:25 PM
]
to survive
[
10:26 PM
]
and due to our biology not advancing alongside our society, culture, and technology, obviously there's going to be some bumps in the road(edited)

GaleToday at 10:26 PM
Fr we live to survive
[
10:27 PM
]
Never really thought there’d be this much conflict to deal with, they happened and now we’re stuck with them

0xToday at 10:28 PM
it's the curse that lives in our skin
[
10:29 PM
]
the devil, satan, lucifer, whatever you want to call it, is merely the personification of humanity's sinister desires
[
10:29 PM
]
some live frightened, thinking that a demon may lie around the next corner
[
10:31 PM
]
but truly, they are their [own] worst nightmare, they are the demons in the night, the silhouette over the moonlight.
