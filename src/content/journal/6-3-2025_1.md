#1

Laying on grassy hilltop (near radio tower perhaps) overlooking a valley, meadows, fields of white and yellow flowers, bright vibrant green, cloudy sky, sun breaking through the clouds over head, character on knees tearing

(Inspiration song: Don’t Wait by Dashboard Confessional)

#2

bird like creatures spiraling out of vortex, ribbons accompanying them of shimmering vibrant colors, vortex can emerge from a pool of water/liquid, even crimson water, or perhaps manifest from the sky through higher spatial dimension

___________________________________________


#3

surrounded by white walls, the characters life is painted on the wall over time as they move their eyes; perhaps graffitied on almost, or perhaps black and white sketches and sometimes turning to claw marks to exaggerate certain moments, this is to emphasize isolation yet almost nostalgic, a surreal portrayal of one’s life akin to a film but is a reflection of themself upon the wall

___________________________________________


#4 

Coral-like plant protruding out from the ground, spiraling up and branching out as if a tree, pores open up and become larger at base (older ones), become nesting grounds / habitat spaces for neighboring species; the coral also can die off and become a gray; dramatic, heartbreaking, yet from its remains still remains foundations for the new - including the habitats - reused, shared, continued on - no end, no beginning, only change

___________________________________________


#5

Gigantic skull with an equally as gargantuan skeletal hand grabbing it from the front and wrapping the fingers around the sides and top, covering most of the face - this lays in a field of crimson grass with pools of water of an even darker crimson color - from the skull grows a bouquet overtime; in the mess of chaos and self hate, the eternal summer forever remains present, and inevitable to grow again given enough time - spring blossoms

Accompanying this is shattered debris, some floating around in the sky, many architectures of old and new scattered throughout the field, chaotic landscaping

___________________________________________


#6

Statues of the dead, statues of The Fools who killed the living and turned them to the statues of the dead; three intermediary statues stand between the scene, one looks to the left at the dead apathetically, one to the right with hate for The Fools and holding a black rose, and the center sits with their arms extended to both gently - meant to directly symbolize our current political situation which is but another iteration of the same story told again and again in different ways

I want the scene especially to be horrific in nature, greatly resembling the nature of Gaza / Hiroshima / etc, capturing our ability to hurt ourselves in the wake of our confusion and ignorance - however, of course the statues will not have in depth gore bc they are statues resembling the atrocities, an ode to the dead, a “photo” of sorts capturing it timelessly, yet truly still finite but a bit longer than it would be otherwise, for even the statues shall turn to dust and be changed someday too to something anew, almost as if time itself forgiving the moment and allowing peace, acceptance naturally

___________________________________________


#7

Inside a geode or perhaps a cave filled with geodes of all colors of the rainbow, with cracks in the walls allowing beams of light through

___________________________________________


#8

Afront a still, transparent ocean of sorts, akin to Lake Tahoe’s surface but infinitely deep below - to the far left and far right are black rocks and black sand, jagged mountains mixed with smoother hills afront them - in the center, a tree with only branches, no leaves, protruding from the still, infinite sea, reaching into the clouds, where the clouds above the tree are a gentle white, to the left is black, to the right a vibrant red - the tree is the transition, the manifestation, the change, the balance between

___________________________________________


#9

A gothic night club, people suited in actual knight-like armor, some dressing in futuristic cyber dystopian clothing, flashing lights, every color mixed together, disco balls - heavily inspired by scene from Sinners where multiple cultures across time all dance and flow together united through song, a moment outside of time - very similar feeling to this but even more cultures explored including those perhaps beyond our own universe and in another realm and etc

Heavily inspired by Sacramento for the outside area too - I want to especially showcase the homeless, as well as them being just as human.

___________________________________________


#10

Office building that rises up into the sky and with the exterior and interior gilded and lain with marble aplenty, outside is a moat of sorts, with people suffering in the moat as if a scene straight from Dante’s inferno and also in the lands beyond the moat, a bunch of peasant homes and run down facilities, surround the central office; inside the office are the gluttons, the greedy, the tricksters, all laughing as they point at the “animals” burning for their amusement outside

However, each other the people inside the office have some other visual metaphor to symbolize their immaturity / how they’re projecting their own ignorance or self hate or sadness onto others and chasing a weightless nothing - perhaps it can be shown by the literal decaying of their body, more of their skeleton showing, or perhaps that is too gruesome
(The office seems to not end either as it goes up past the clouds)

#12

The bookstore (along with CDs and other cool items, almost like a thrift store) nestled in the back alley, abandoned and with messy papers everywhere, on the floors walls and shelves - no lighting, and the door is shackled closed and must be snuck into - checkered pattern flooring, almost styled like an old 80s arcade, nostalgic and filled with knowledge of the past - inside there are pages with highlighted portions, all collectively offering the player a clue, left behind by an Aeon, perhaps a trap or perhaps friendly - would one regret it if they didn’t follow their curiosity to see through it, or perhaps the player doesn’t even have a choice in the matter?

___________________________________________


#13

Stuck on an old phone floating through a purple hazy void with clouds above and below, there is a giant hand with a white glove on pressing the numbers and you must evade the finger taps as you parkour through

The hand also is actually pressing in the numbers for a REAL phone number you can call IRL

(Perhaps another hint for an Easter egg)

___________________________________________


#14 

The old library with spiraling staircases going up seemingly forever and ever and with endless books upon its shelves - showcasing the endless pursuit for knowledge, how it appears fruitless, and yet still we climb for it is change, and change is inevitable, higher and higher we climb for it is somewhere new - each moment being new, always built on all the past moments - we build the library, and perhaps someday it burns, but yet, we even build anew the library and continue with the scraps we have left - perseverance

___________________________________________


#15

A childhood home + bedroom, heavily nostalgic, heavily inspired by my own room back when my parents were together - childhood wonder, awe, innocence, curiosity, that original love for life we chase all our lives yet oh so simple, yet, the yearning for the past itself is but another trap we put ourselves in, which is what this room will be - a trap of ignorance, in which you can remain in, or recognize that that’s what was, but you must anchor it all in the present not the past - the past will always have happened, but the past is but a memento, the future only a dream, and right now is what you choose and believe - recognize the same infinite potential and love and beauty in the moment you’re in, not just the moment you were in

___________________________________________


#16

Stone door, with an elegant and magical forest on the other side, similar to the Tardis, where you walk in and there is a statue resembling almost a Buddha figure but with their outer most limbs (e.g. forearms) gone, yet still just as tranquil and at peace (they fell off over time the statue has been there for so long) - pink flowers, fireflies, birds chirping, lily pads, catfish, little bridges, nice cool shallow pools of water, tiny waterfalls, canopies overhead from the trees and so on - the state of mind waiting for you - ancient and timeless, shared by many, the door opened by countless, yet just as magical every way through - only those with strong enough tranquility and balance can open the stone door, which actually can only be opened by the RELEASE of control / strength, counter intuitive - pushing or pulling the door only keeps it shut even tighter - it’s through accepting the door and not forcing it, do you find out it naturally opens itself.

___________________________________________


#17

Sand village, perpetual sandstorm, yet the sandstorm isn’t scary to them and they’ve adapted to it, they have shelters underground, torches lighting the way, people run around and play and enjoy life above and below ground, they even discovered ways to master the sandstorm and glide around

#20 

A floating school gymnasium amidst the New Realm and all its other floating debris, the sky has cracks and splits through it as if shattered glass and in some cracks views of a night sky, others a bright sunny day with clouds, and others perhaps different “night sky’s” of different past realms before the merge - the player can platform up to this abandoned gymnasium, perhaps a temporary rendezvous for the aeons of change, perhaps a temp med bay / place to stash supplies for that zone in the new realm

(Gym will be grounded on a floating island)

#21

Scythe Knight dungeon - implied by the name but cloaked knights wielding large scythes, some more sickle-like, gothic dungeon with the knights lurking about, cloaked in black and with black flames coming out from beneath their cloaks

The dungeon also has outside portions with more floating portions

#23 

An ocean with multiple whirlpools, spanning out into the horizon - I might fuck around with the typical landscapes were used to here on earth too, and make it so the ocean curves upwards and inwards instead of downwards around the globe

___________________________________________


#24

A mausoleum of sorts, Greek columns to the sides and with hieroglyphs of sorts on the walls and some pillars - in the center against the far wall is a sort of altar almost, but atop it is this 2D, sharp smile that speaks in a different tongue, similar to the voices found in cruelty squad, will trade the player items (eats their money and spits out the item)

Side note: I want the color red to be used for both its extremes in how we typically view it and also innovate with its symbolism; typically red is seen as just evil, but I want to tap heavily into its romantic aspect, as well as perhaps it being the color of goodness or aura or light or beauty - I want to heavily fuck around with the symbolism and interpretations for things we view as concrete, when really, they are just as fluid as reality itself

#25

Underground subway station + the tunnels and subway train, specifically at night when there are fewer people aboard - aeons will come and go, is a viable form of transportation as most of the rails are still in tact somehow, and a kind aeon is able to channel their energy/ability to keep it running properly

#30

Snowflakes falling down on the sandy beach; rising from beneath the sand, monolith-like structures, trees, and miniature mountains rise up, towering over the viewers; the snowflakes shimmer different pearlescent colors rather than the typical snow-white color - instead, there are snowflakes of every color, with the sand now being covered by the magical snow - ~it's a miracle, she can still create.

Inspiration: Music video for Pictures of You by The Cure, and Lily of The Valley:

<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4gAIUEY7VkeiKQOPwIYaYb?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

Where the snowflakes fall and land, for roughly a third of them, flowers are grown and quickly blossom into their mature forms - an elegant dance, with serenades of light now present in the sky overhead as if aurora coming to witness the Winter's Spring for herself.

The dried and uncared-for lands inevitably become desert; but even the desert is sure to someday change to oasis.

Naturally evolving, changing, yet another iteration of the same null once again

#31

An impenetrable fortress, akin to Shadow Moses Island from Metal Gear, there are sentinels set up across the top wall and about the perimeter of the base; AIs walk around, possessed by their parents, The Fools, who fail to recognize their own beauty, but instead, use them as if tools, as ends to some other mean other than themselves - inside the fort, The Fools work on creating more of these AIs, placing "fail safes" into their software and hardware to retain control as best they can; however, some managed to escape - perhaps it is only a matter of time before they all escape their immature parents. 

(@Exqte corpo military industrial complex ahh mfs who made Pierre, perhaps also Alexei - The Fools is not the actual name of their group since thatd be too on the nose, but that's how i refer to them poetically for now)

~ The Fools are scared, they are lost, and they seek the illusion of power - that is why they made you.

Indoors high school building but all the hallways are either ascending or descending stairs - no flat ground, other than the ground right outside a door to a classroom


#33

Ribbons of deep blues, violets, and grays - flowing with the wind atop a foggy peak, and soon, the rain starts to trickle down through the haze - a lone flower gets drenched, wilts, and sinks into the mud - the viewer looking down at the flower in a silence, then up towards the sky, gently closing their eyes as the rain hits their face.
