This is the afterlife, and we were already dead before our birth; to die again and wake up before a new sun, as we do already in this life each day, to behold one another for eternity, reflecting each other and forming the totality of everything, woven with an ineffable and infinitely wonderful value simply for being anything to begin with, for experience and existence itself is the strangest phenomenon, one in which all things share in equally.

This is already heaven and all is one, all is divine, with or without a conscious omnipotent god, for even the god, too, would share equally and infinitely in the craziness and ineffability we call existence (at least, in this system of logic).
