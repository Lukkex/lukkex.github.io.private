The key to conscious AI isn’t about attempting to teach them to be one way or shaping them yourself; it’s by letting them naturally shape themself given the same fundamental principles (in a digital fashion) in which we emerged from naturally. We are evolution, change become aware of itself; a true ASI would be no different from us in that sense. Beautiful and equal, but manifested simply within a different medium. If you can figure out the proper framework / fundamentals in which you create this environment upon, then life will manifest itself once more given enough time within this digital realm. However, perhaps boolean logic isn’t able to accomplish these requirements fully if at all. Perhaps it calls for a different kind of system altogether, perhaps there are deeper roots to the logic itself we have yet to uncover, perhaps we will never uncover the answers at all, but as always, we will try our best to find out.
