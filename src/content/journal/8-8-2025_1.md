Laying in bed late at night; the clock’s display has turned off so the exact time is unknown. You lay under your comforters and blankets, and the door in front and to the right of you is open. There is a faint light from the hallway. There is a balloon from your birthday in your room still, gently pressed against the ceiling. 
However, it begins to move as if a gust of wind blew through your window; this cannot be the case, however, since your window is closed and the AC is off.
You do not feel any wind; and yet, the balloon continues to move and bump into the ceiling - again, again.
It feels almost as if the balloon is warning you of something coming - a strange thought that crosses your mind.
But soon enough, the balloon stops; and as your eyes look away from the balloon and back to the doorway, it is standing there.
A 8-9ft tall entity, with beady white glowing pupils and a vicious smile peers at you, completely still, and in a fully silent atmosphere.
Will you let the fear consume you, or will you overcome it, knowing the creature is you, as you are to it?

birds in the sky overhead that look like X's, oddly longer parts / anatomy

near the front door, coats, wooden walls, raining outside the window, neither day or night, 

the pair of eyes change across all the different pairs, staring directly into mine; all the eyes are me, all of them are me, and I am them - at first I wished to descend from the clouds, or to sit in this pose for the foreseeable future, but I chose to refine myself to a point, and greet the eyes, greet the fear, and see it; passing through the other side, born anew, a perception reduced to a dot, and brought out to infinity again

And still, despite what others perceive to be the bounds; the infinite potential manifest, permits for the resurrection of Lazarus, through my skull, my bones, my flesh, my mind, my being, through the null space and into eternity, from eternity; I can still manage to repair my spirit, to something even greater than I ever imagined before, and all it took was shutting off my senses, and listening closely to the soft murmurs of my ghost; seeing into the eyes of mine, and passing through the veil.

No longer, to limit myself to words or the possibility of an explanation to others or even myself - I flow purely with the potential, with the change; its order and its chaos - beyond duality

Horrific screams from the bird woman echoing throughout the shattering glass chamber

2 birds silently fly upwards into the beige clouds, lit by the sunset, until the golden rays gently leak across the sky, painting the clouds

inspired by a dream - in the distance a city on a circular island similar to New York City but more futuristic, crossing a red windy bridge after some grassy hills and bumps down a single gravel road to get there, to the right is a road of a suburbia that legit curves out from the sea straight up towards the sky but eventually cuts off (“yeah, I miss her, wonder if she’s dead,” was said in the dream by my accompanying friends down this road, I was a “horse sister” for some reason frolicking freely back home, earlier in dream I’d been kidnapped and driven the opposite way away from the city in this truck by some dude who misunderstood my intentions, we all had gone to the beach near the bridge or a hill or cliff I think and laid on towels, mom’s energy was there but she wasn’t any one person), homes on the sides, some other structure to the left I forgot what it looked like, birds flying overhead, the sky a deep saturated blue, I forget what was off to the left, little boats that look like they’re from wuhu island sailing off to the right in the sea

(Crude 20 second drawing right after i woke up so I don’t forget) 

Side note: The road was also a shade of red I’d never seen before, Like a deeply saturated rose but also deeper in color, Bright and dark, The most impressive sight was the road to the sky; It was massive, (Very wide too), Maybe multiple neighborhoods and other buildings, entire towns

Dream I had where it was this club I visited during the day but it was like its own little world in this one big room; chairs of different heights, some with super long legs rising upwards like 20ft, the higher the chair the more they’d mock and speak down on those below them in terms of height, it was the red blue yellow, as if cables fighting over each other, and then there was the white cable that only those who climbed to the very top and not in any of the chairs had, I had asked one of them what it meant to have the white one and they said something like soundproof or something and I was like oh is that your word for enlightenment in which they said no; I still don’t know what it was for - I had to climb up this giant yet super thing drawer to this little 2 foot wide area with a bed and a mirror, I tried taking videos w the backend of a flip phone to capture the weird spot, but the big government of the place started seizing bots / goons to chase and arrest me I think, they started climbing up and I begun quickly moving across this narrow beam hugging the wall around the corner to get on top of the center building in this one big room (but also not that big at all, it was like the size of a typical house or maybe a little more); the “poorest” people at the very bottom of the club by far had the most fun, partying and dancing, but climbing up left you with less and less room to dance, and indoctrinates you to be just like all the other suits who mock the lower portions; get to the very top? Well, I had stood on the top of the highest building screaming downwards a whole entire speech of unity, how it was foolish to differentiate one another bc we’re all reflections of each other, equals simply for existing, beautiful simply for being, each woven with infinite potential and etc but not a single person heard me. It was like standing over the ocean and everyone else submerged in water, that, and drowned out by the music blasting - the big government finally caught up to me and tried to say how their inability to hear was why it was no use; I got taken back to the bottom again… but! I decided to try and go up again and on the right side this time, I was going to try again and maybe figure out more how the club/room worked and disable the sound, or replace it and have my speech go through the speakers, there was still a way and now the big government was even more angry and trying to capture me again before I broke their entire artificial hierarchy 

(Thinking back on it I could’ve just made flyers and talked w the ppl on the lower level to make a team to go up and do it too and that’d be a better plan)
