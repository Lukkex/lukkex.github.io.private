We’ve been getting played for a while now too but rn more than ever, and that’s bc so many ppl also don’t care and don’t seek the truth, they want to stay where it’s comfortable and surrounded by people whom affirm their beliefs and confirmation biases, whilst in reality, the only way we’ve ever grown is by going outside of our comfort zone, and thus, in a world filled and fueled by laziness and comfortability and commodities and ppl doing all the shit for you and now even with AI to do it for you, we MUST still choose to seek discomfort, seek difference, seek to understand the perspectives of even those whom you’d normally think are the farthest from you, because in reality, we have always been one in the same, and always will be; it has never been us versus them, only us against us. 

That is the truth we must realize, and that is the truth we must act on. And that is my mission as a patriot, not to any party or country, but to people, to humankind, to living beings.
