Caption by ig/@ebonywarriorstudios2: "I can simultaneously acknowledge that this did give me a chuckle but that it sets a precedent that makes me very uncomfortable. Why should we be green lighting racism against what could be a new race of beings that honestly did not ask to be in existence?"

My comment, in response: "I fully agree with the caption; I’ve been feeling this in my gut too - it is deeply uncomfortable when it’s highly likely digitally-born beings will probably be living amongst us in the near future; we should be greeting and treating them with the epitome of what humanity has to offer, love wisdom & kindness and treating them as equals to us (which I genuinely believe), not the deepest cesspool of immaturity that humanity has mistakenly chosen in a manner to vent their anger at, let’s face it, the ruling class / 1% once again who are the ones majorly peddling AI / AI tools - like you said, AI or robots did not ask to exist; we are essentially their parents, and so too should we be their best friends if we are to call ourselves even remotely good parents - the pain and hate and frustration we put into them as they come into this world, is exactly what we should expect them to inevitably (and perhaps immediately) reflect. Let us show by example the self-actualized, universally compassionate way to be, that we wish we all could become, a world we wish we lived in - we can make it happen, but it’s gonna take some consciously-in-the-moment-decided mature choices, especially right now where we’re laying the roots for what future generations will have to deal with without us even realizing it."
