Keep going and you’ll find what you’re looking for


You won’t find answers, but you’ll find understanding


That there isn’t one solid answer, that answers are only answers if you let them be, an understanding and acceptance that although we all may be forever ignorant (which is what makes us human to begin with and is the greatest gift of all bc it’s the one thing God/the origin/where everything stems from cannot experience, and what also allows us to forever have another step to climb - the myth of sisyphus is the dance our species has played out since our creation, and will continue to do so, but itself is so fantastically tragic it’s beautiful; art, woven to be perfectly imperfect) and although the past is but a reminder, the future a blurry dream, right now we can enjoy and bask in, while its seconds few, but few those seconds, and an ineffable, infinite value of each is born through that inevitable death, an experience held only once and never to be experienced the same again; remembered forever in history even when no one is left to remember.
