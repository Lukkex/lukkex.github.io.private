If I were to ever lose my memory, the person who’d remain would not be [old name]. My memories, my experiences, my ideology is what makes me, me. We all believe that we each have a soul and carry these with us even into the afterlife, but that wouldn’t really be closure, now would it? We’d continue to want to live forever and never lose ourselves because we desire our individuality and respond automatically internally to reject the idea that we all make up a system are merely just ants in a colony from a standpoint view outside our societal bubble - it’s wired into us after all, we love being unique; we love being us. And regardless, since we all reside within a singularity (universe with time within a singularity or a singularity in of itself) that means that one instance of each of our lives is something of the sort of an infinite snapshot of the universe, stored forever yet passes faster than the blink of an eye. I may not live forever to us - within this reality - but to The Peak of Paradox, I will live forever within these moments.  So, in a way, we do have souls; yet fragile as the wings of a butterfly - disrupted, warped, damaged, and destroyed with ease.
