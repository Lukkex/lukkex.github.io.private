I write these posts to store my ghost. 


To get out there small phrases that attempt to echo the millions in my mind, to possibly give someone out there a bit of comfort, guidance, relation, love for the world in spite of the ever-growing hatred, greed, and deception. 


Maybe one person will see this. 
Maybe three, or four. 
Maybe someday, somehow, more than I can anticipate. 


But I write these not for numbers, or for my name in a book, but for good, a good beyond good and evil itself, I like to think, and perhaps to continue beyond my expiration. 


Worth a shot, right? :)
