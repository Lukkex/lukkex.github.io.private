What a wonderful dream this life is. I could not ask for anything greater, than to be instead of never being, and I am so happy to have shared that alongside you all, as we will always have had shared long past the end of days, our story is already forever even if nobody remembers it, and knowing that gives me the greatest feeling of joy and love.
