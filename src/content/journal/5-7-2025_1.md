It’s always about the money with corporations, and not about the people, when in reality, a truly valuable action is when you do something for the person as an end to themself, for no other ulterior motive or end - you do good to do good, you love to love, you dance to dance, you create art to create art, and much like art, our actions are yet another paint stroke upon a different canvas, though a different medium, all the while, still just as much as an end to itself. 

To not understand this is to be immature, and to remain in it is to be indifferent or opposed to change - and, as the saying goes, the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference, and that is precisely what this corporate society fuels most; money over soul, money over true value, money over people, money over love and passion, money over themselves. It’s unfortunate; but change is inevitable, and we shall inevitably, someday, evolve beyond this immature stage, even if we come to destroy our species and this world, inevitably, somewhere in someplace intelligent beings will emerge, and eventually, one of them will get it right (if not already somewhere out there or beyond our senses). 

In other words; change is eternal, and thus, hope is just as eternal as well.
