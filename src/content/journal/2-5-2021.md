I wish to learn how to do and do everything I possibly can and gain as much knowledge as possible and yet, it might be entirely fruitless, but at the same time, not pointless at all, because I exist and am here to perceive these things and make something from nothing, my form of reality only exists because I perceive it in the ways that I do, without my presence, the story told from beyond these eyes never would’ve existed.

“Ik, I’m planning on seeing my neurologist hopefully soon

Hopefully it’ll be reversible, if not however, then ig someone else will be living in this body soon enough

Take my memories and my experiences, you take my soul too, and yknow what, I’m fine with that, it’s all set in stone anyways - predestined, and all things happen for a reason so, I guess I’ll see where the road takes me”

Beachside paradise

A simple breeze 

Breathe in

Breathe out


Wake up

It’s 10 past 7

Stayed up late again I see?


Look in the mirror

Minutes are seconds

Breathe in

Breathe out


Get ready, it’s time to spectate

Watch yourself walk through the door

Drive to work, talk with friends, it’s all the same


Keep going, you’ve gotta last longer, right?

Move your feet, you can only go forward

Previous locations fill the rear view mirror


Go, go, go

Keep going

You’ll find your peace one day - your mind if you’re lucky

Breathe in

Breathe out

Breathe

Breathe

Please breathe

I can’t

Where

Where did everybody go

Where are my friends

Where am I

Where am I

Where 


When

When did I lose myself

When did I lose it all

When did I lose 

When did I lose

When did I lose


Why

Why am I here

Why am I hurt

Who hurt me, me - who?

Why

Why, why why why


How

How am I hurt

How do I feel

How should I feel

How does this all work

I’m not sure

And I’m not sure you’re sure either


I’m dying, dy-ing 

no, I’m drowning

Swim, but I can’t breathe

Breathe, but there’s no air

Breathe

Breathe

Breathe[.]
