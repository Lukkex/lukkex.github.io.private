i have never done any drugs in my life

lmfao

i have no need for psychedelics either other than maybe just for the experience of it, but the mindset derived thru ego death i already have found thru critical thought over the course of my life

(replied to first message)

my art style attempts to lucidly embrace the infinite complexity and beauty of reality, the infinite freedom of the human spirit + creation, and the joy i feel from coming thru horrid shit i had to put up w life only to finally uncover i already had everything i could ever want; to simply exist at all in the first place, instead of never existing to begin with

my art IS my drug, in shorter words

i have no need for lsd because my art IS my lsd already

reality is fluid and ppl often mistake it for being constant, or linear, or limited and restricted - time is relative, everyone is their own main character (sonder) and thus their own center of everything, and everything is abnormal, and thats why its beautiful

oh and speaking of my website

i added more past logs to it

also it prob seems cult-like bc i indeed use a lot of archetypes and symbols and stuff throughout my style, such as the ouroboros, the yin yang, uraeus the snake (origin for the infinity symbol), and so on

and w the overall appearance too

but i am of no doctrine, no cult, no religion

i just merely be tryna capture what i see as this little human i am

symbols that approximate different concepts told time and time again across many different cultures, religions, etc

The complex euphoria of creation

such as dualism for example, where one cannot exist without its contrast: some iterations of this archetype include, heaven and hell or god and the devil (Christianity), or perhaps god and the demiurge (gnosticism), the point of absolute and the illusion keeping oneself from enlightenment (the :Om:, in buddhism, hinduism), up and down, left and right, good and evil, light and dark, and so on and so forth - for every "presence," it automatically has an absence - otherwise, how are you to tell the difference between the foreground and the background if theyre both the same color? if there was only presence of that one thing, or only absence of that one thing? total presence or total absence are essentially identical states of nothingness, nothing happening, nothing changing, and that is why the two polar opposites are required in order to form a spectrum - a spectrum, much like between the numbers 0 and 1, have an infinite number of numbers between the two of them, different states between absence and presence - thus, permitting change - and we? we as living beings are change aware of itself. it only makes sense we weave this iconic dance of contrasts each and everywhere we look, because in our system of logic it is literally required in order for anything to not only exist, to be discernable from any other thing, to be different from a state of nothingness / zero entropy, but also for life itself to take place, for usto happen. this is one of the major archetypes that permits reality, in our system of logic. another archetype is recursion; the microcosm to the macrocosm, much like how neurons in the human brain look nearly identical to superclusters formed in our universe, aka the largest known celestial structure

i hope you can start to see where im coming from

i am not here to declare some new religion, but to comment on the nature of religions as a whole, to recognize patterns i see in this beautiful universe as best i can - ofc, nothing can fully 100% truly be proven nor disproven, for everything is a guess; but that is why i try to give it my best guess, and refine that guess overtime - and thus, again, i say it is critical thought that brought me here, not raw superstition or drugs

Ye, I see the basis of the your thoughts

we tell the same things, the same archetypes, the same morals, the same message(s), through different symbols, cultures, dances, art forms, languages, etc. - we are all reflections of the same thing trying to describe itself in a different way out of the infinite possible ways to speak it

and like le epic jesse welles says in his song war is a god:

> It don't matter who was here first
> It don't matter who was last
> All that matters is we're here right now
> Could the past just be the past?
> Bloodshed and starvation
> Bloodshed, take heed
> They both got the same damn god
> They just don't know how to read

and

> Maybe man don't make the war
> Maybe war is just a god
> And every bullet, every bombshell
> Meditations thrown aloft
> Bloodshed and starvation
> Bloodshed and pain
> We all got the same damn god
> We just call it different names
