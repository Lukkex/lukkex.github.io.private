We must unite against this system and demand better and forge it ourselves if we must, a better world and a better future for us all and the next generations. This phase is temporary; soon we will develop into either cyberpunk 2077 oligarchic theocratic tech bro fascism, OR, we can all rise the fuck up and make the future that we always dreamed of since we were little, a better world for ALL people, for ALL life and perhaps even robot kind too someday. And so, what’ll it be? Seep back into inaction and apathy, or rise up to be apart of something far greater than we ever could’ve seen ourselves becoming? 

Cheers. 💜

Been a long time coming; welcome to full-blown fascist amerika. We are beyond the point of just dinner table arguments and political debates; our government served its purpose to protect the 1% / ruling class, our congress sidestepped to allow this to take place and many gladly bending over to DT, “how far god emperor daddy donny?” - and now the people are the last line of defense. First it starts with rocks getting thrown, and then molotovs. And then next thing you know, shots are going off. People are going to get killed, and this is the chaos that was voted for, this was the chaos that was promised, and this is the chaos that has now arrived here in the present moment plain as day. 

And so, again, I welcome you to fascist Amerika. 

Organize, unite, and revolt against this theocratic authoritarian state. 

Stay strong, and stay safe.

I hate the system, not you. 

I hate your anger, not you; you are so much more than your anger. 

I hate your fear, not you; you are so much more than your fear. 

I hate that we haven’t gotten along, not you; fighting even more was never the way to solve our fighting. And for now, that’s the fool’s game we’re playing… until we can come to bridge the gap and grow beyond ourselves towards a brighter future for everyone.

Tired of liberals and republicans, tired of the entire system. It has failed us time and time again. Not gonna do the whole song and dance of it again; the game is broken, we can’t “vote” our way out of this and we especially can’t vote the systematic prejudices out either or our intermingling with Israel / AIPAC. Hate the country, but I love the people in it. That’s why we demand better and will never stop, even if we gotta make it happen ourselves. We are so much more than the childish bickering, so much more than the hate and fear. Cheers.

Everything's always okay given enough time; there is no beginning, there is no end, there is only change - and the bad always always right as rain changes back to day, someday - but I didn't need to tell you that for you to already know that, cuz we've both known, that little twinkle of light that catches a keen eye that can be found in any little thing, the magic of love, kindness, and simply just being, to always have been, and to someday be again. It's all gonna be ok no matter what happens 🫂💜
