I think the biggest most epic epiphany I’ve had (about time) today is 

# Greater goals = greater actions

So it’s literally in your best interest to set the highest goals possible; don’t like have the mindset that you’re value is derived from what you’ve done, but what you COULD do, and we all can do literally anything we set our minds to, like infinity and so we’re all worth infinity

## And change itself IS action

## Life IS a series of actions

And so if you ain’t acting you’re basically functionally dead already so no point in living

## It’s the classic question of to be or not to be again

You either sit still and remain dead, or ACT and thus LIVE

And THUS, if you ARE gonna *be*, might as well have the biggest greatest most rewarding actions possible (towards the biggest goals possible, aka YOU decide the end whatever it may be, a spectrum from start to finish, and along the journey constantly evolving just like life itself, once again, microcosm to the macrocosm), BE the best you can in each moment

Which is why facing the goals that scare you the most, aka the biggest ones imaginable that scare you will also change you the most and thus make you live the most
