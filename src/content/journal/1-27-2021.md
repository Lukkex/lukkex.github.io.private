We all could die any day, and there's a beauty in that. 
Life is fragile: perfectly sculpted, shattered when the wind blows.

Everything came from nothing, meaning came from the meaningless - your meaning is what you make it.

There is so much I wish to get out into paper that I most likely will never be able to get to. Thoughts rush in and out of my mind constantly throughout the day and many I canâ€™t even begin to put into words within my own mind; they come as feelings - subconsciously understanding and stringing concepts together, it seems like.

Memories, qualia, emotion - souls, delicate and frail; wings to a butterfly who may only dance for so long.
