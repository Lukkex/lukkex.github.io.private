My "qruack" phase is definitely long past; started that page back in freshmen year of HS in 2017 to post memes for just friends n stuff and only had 300 followers for like 3 years of it, and uh.... now it is 6 years later lmfao, on the forefront i am basically like the entire opposite of a person, i mean obv that just comes w/ age and especially by not being in pissbaby gossip, low self esteem P.O.S. central high school anymore 
[

in all honestly im not into meme culture like at all anymore, i used to be super into it way back before MLG

I actually found your page when I was a Freshman and I sent all your shit to a buddy of mine because we both found your page hilarious. But I totally get what you mean, now that I’m in college, stuff’s just different.

It’s crazy to me that I’m actually talking to you, now that I think about it. Cuz like, I have been following your page for like 4 or 5 years or whatever, along with TONS of others, but the other pages were like fast food chains while yours was a fancy restaurant. Like my buddies and I all follow plenty of meme pages as well as “real” accounts too, and we would send our brainrot junk food memes back and forth from pages like godspods, grandmas.butt, functioned, zucc, etc. but they were never like super consistent. Don’t get me wrong, I love some of those pages, but a “sent a post by qruack” message always guaranteed quality. It seems like a stupid thing to be writing a long message about, meme pages, but it was a massive part of my social life with my friends and inside jokes and stuff in high school, so I guess it’s more important to me than I thought. Thanks for being so fucking funny, I guess is what I’m trying to say lol. You did a great job.

I had no clue I really had that much of an effect on ppl, that ppl actually saw my posts as "me" instead of just the meme as it was itself

Oh god you can tell so much about the page owner by their posts it’s crazy. You never had ads, at least not any that I remember but I assume none, so I can tell you genuinely enjoyed and cared about what you were doing. Everything you posted was funny as hell, so you clearly have a good sense of humor and can do great quality control for your output. You didn’t just shit posts out, there was obviously thought behind them.

You’re someone who cares about making other people’s days better, whether that’s a small or large amount. You don’t want to force a shitty smile through sheer quantity, you want a genuine smile from a quality laugh. You do it for the people, not for the fame. It’s crystal clear dude.

i never thought anyone really noticed that stuff before, i'd just tell myself that bc i think sticking to ur morals is far more important than any materialistic shit ever; sticking to love and passion, putting it above all else, i genuinely actually don't even care about money it's so funny how little i spend ever

I’m just telling you how it is. Not trying to butter you up to ask for money or anything (unless?), just thought you should know my experience with your online influence. It was surreal getting that IG notif for a group chat for my favorite page, joining the server, and instantly getting like 400 roles and becoming chill with you, as well as all the other awesome people in there. It happened really fast but it wasn’t artificial. It was, to quote the server, “real.”

i am like best friends with so many ppl ive met thru my gram, and often i literally forget that i even have the page at all to begin with, bc it's never been abt the numbers, it's just an effective way to meet cool ppl online instead of like, going into an online game where the only 2 ppl who talk are cussing racial slurs

I understand why people think that, but I agree with you. Nobody is “above” anyone else (unless they’re in a plane BAHAHAHAHAHA sorry), we shouldn’t act like some dude with 43M subs is a god among men.
