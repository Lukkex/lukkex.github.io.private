I'm me, that's all I sorta know in this ever changing world, and that's all I really do need to know, is that I am, and I'm here in this moment, not forever, but in this moment I'm here, and you're here too, and that's more incredible than we can ever hope to define, because nothing really makes any sense to exist in the first place, but who ever said it needed to make sense for it to be? :3

Doesn't make sense to exist, yet we're still hereâ€¦ somehow

And that's awesome

Even if the moment sucks a lot sometimes

At least we still, are, I guess

And even when the sun explodes

When the earth vaporizes

When a billion billion billion years go by

And the last star fades to nothing

And the universe comes to a close

Nothing can ever take away the fact, that at some point

We existed

So in that sense, at least

We're immortal

Fragile, so very fragile

Existent in time

Destined to die

Yet, by living in the first place

We can't ever truly fully die

And same goes for the memories we make

And the people we choose to surround ourselves with

And the meaning we try to make for ourselves

In some way, it means something, even tho nothing can ever be defined, that just means it's perhaps a meaning beyond meaning; something no amount of words can ever describe. And I think that's the realest definition one can hope for, for the word Beautiful.
