Me to a friend of mine:

You would LOVE Søren Kierkegaard Shae

You would love love love his work

He is the epitome of “hold up, yall ain’t even Christians and just doing this to go along with society and look like a good person rather than ACTUALLY seeking god / divinity and truth and etc”

He is a real one

He’s the one who came up with the spheres of existence

I’d highly recommend looking into his work

My old philosophy / religion class professor (only 1 of 2 philosophy related courses I’ve ever taken lol and the only religion class I’ve ever taken) was the one who put me onto his work, same with Pierre Teilhard de Chardin

My professor was named Dr. Karam, and he was born right near where Jesus himself was born in Bethlehem, my professor was raised in a little village in the Middle East and has been a devote Catholic his entire life and was aged 62 I believe, he had a Ph D in both philosophy and religion

And you know what’s so incredible about that too?

He fully supported and saw and even taught our class the beauty of e.g. trans, queer, intersex people too.

Like one of if not the most Christian person I’ve ever met in my life and yet one of the most wise and loving too

It just shows how far gone so many “Christian” people are today

And don’t understand the message of love

Our first thing we read in class for a discussion was on this person born intersex, whose parents were Catholic and thought their child was the devil and made them cough into napkins at church and stuff to get rid of the devil and etc, whereas their grandmother was a Native American and viewed it to be a wonderful gift from the great spirit

Kierkegaard, although a devout Catholic too btw, also believed in how the “true” religion for each person was relative to the person, how it’s their own unique way to finding the truth within themself and etc and even without any doctrine or religion at all. I would have LOVED to discuss some things with him, especially Pierre Teilhard de Chardin too, I genuinely consider myself as a far-in-the-future student of Pierre. He spoke of how when humanity recognized the power of love we’ll have discovered fire the second time, how we’re all fragments of god seeking each other, brought together by love. An absolutely brilliant and beautiful mind

Pierre was ALSO a devout Catholic too funny enough lmao
