# <code> WELCOME, V0YAGER. </code>

Here, I will sharing some screenshots from my game I created back in Fall of 2022 for my UNIX course's final project. Just thinking back on this project fills me with such passion and inspiration, I genuinely loved creating this little game so, so very much. :)

If you would like to try it out for yourself, 

<code><i><a href="https://github.com/Lukkex/VoyagersUnixGame">here is the UNIX file.</a></i></code>

To begin, I will show you the initial screen upon running it:

Pretty Edgar-Allen-Poe-esk, ain't it? 

No? 

Eh, well at least I tried. ;3

After hitting Enter, it brings you to this next screen:

A pretty crazy view (even with the lack of colors). If I was able to paint this properly in the terminal, the sky would be gold and red and that sphere in the background would be a crimson sun (so try to imagine that for now).

Hitting Enter again takes you here:

Followed by:

In the center of this crimson field and sat in a shallow pool of water, there is this "being" awaiting your inevitable arrival.

Now, the game can actually begin! (pardon the old name, still kickass tho)

Here, you enter how many (real human) players will be playing in the game.

After entering how many players there will be (with the max being 10), you will now each have a name and start at 100 HP.

The order goes from the lowest number to the last (sorry to whoever goes last, you kind of have a disadvantage there haha).

When it's your turn, you can select from a variety of different moves to do against another player of your choosing.

In all my time testing this game, I surprisingly have never hit move #5 since it has a 5% hit rate (to be fair, though, I didn't really try going for it that often due to the sheer number of misses again and again).

If you hit this in an actual game against someone else though, they likely will be pissed (rightfully so).

After a player's health is depleted, they will no longer show up in the "Alive" list, and you will not be able to attack them anymore.

After all other players are eliminated and you are the last one standing, congrats! 

You've won!

...But at what cost?
