<h1> CAW CAW!!! </h1>

Version 1.0 of Venn, the Aeon of Agony! 

If you'd like to see how I created them, head over to my YouTube channel and check the livestreams!

Stay tuned! More to be added soon! I plan to make even more detailed textures for them in Substance 3D Painter, polish the rig a bit (and make bones for the hair), detail the clothing mesh some more, maybe add some jewelry, and lastly, add some physics!
