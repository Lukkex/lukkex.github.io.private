This animation I actually had made the morning before I left for my trip to Seattle!

It really wasn't too complicated to make this scene + animation; the majority of the time was spent just tweaking the animation little tiny bits at a time until it looked natural enough.

The scene was fairly easy to make; the terrain is just a plane I split into multiple segments both ways using Ctrl+R in Blender (I believe is the shortcut, anyways) and then raised up some bits; higher in the distance, shorter up front, presenting the illusion there was more beyond the hills (but maybe there actually was üëÅ ü§´). 

After making the clouds bounce a little bit (pressing I to create a keyframe at the start, moving to the middle and moving them a little bit and pressing I again, then moving to twice the distance from the start aka the end and adding another keyframe, then doing Ctrl+Shift+E to make the keyframes cyclical), I posed Pierre using my IKs in a meditative position.

The eye moves around using an IK, and each of the eyelids have their own bone as well!

The main part that gave this animation depth was the PSX plugin I used to induce that vertex-snapping artifacting I love that's found in old-school games (which I also intend on making myself from scratch in my game as well). The glitchy effects and static are also done in post in Adobe Premiere Pro.

And... yep! That's all there was to it. This animation took at most an hour given everything done. :3
