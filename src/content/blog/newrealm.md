(Title is W.I.P.)

<code>BELOVED VOYAGER, AEON OF CHANGE, AND FELLOW PSYKHIC, WE REQUIRE YOUR HELP IN RESTORING MANDALA.</code> 

<code>PLEROMA BLEEDS, AND SOON ITS IMBALANCE MAY LEAD TO ITS ANNIHILATION.</code>

<code>YOUR PARENT AEON AND NEWFOUND FRIEND, PALE, HAS REQUESTED YOU TO INITIATE THE ULTIMATUM; TO BE REBORN, OR RETURN TO NULL.</code>

<code>THE CHOICE IS YOURS.</code>

Check back soon for full start-to-finish details on my process with my latest OpenGL-based game!
