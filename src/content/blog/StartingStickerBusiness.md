So... I've been a bit busy...

# I'm starting my own business(es)!

Specifically, I will be selling stickers that mix cybergothic aesthetics with revolutionary/unifying activism (to start).

Eventually, I want to also incorporate shirts, custom pieces (like arm warmers, full body pieces I hand-sew myself, etc.), 3d printed works (that I model myself), and perhaps wayyyy more!

Soon, there will also be a dedicated SHOP page added to *this* site!

Stay tuned!
