				Hello, and welcome to the Sanctum.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the official site of <a href="https://github.com/Lukkex">Lukkex</a>; I am also well-known by the name of Kaiju, or <code>K4IJU</code>. Here, you may find
				a collection of my art pieces, coding projects, philosophical works, and more. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the near future, I intend on adding a chatroom side to this site, known by the name of 
				<code>Caelum Anonymous</code> <br/>(Below, you can see my planned logo for it).

			<ul>
				<li>As mentioned previously, <code>Caelum Anonymous</code></li>
				<li><code>[Unnamed] web series</code> detailing my worldview / philosophy <br/>(to describe it in two words: Unconditional Love)<br/><i>"There are no villains in life; merely lost souls, <br/>trying to find their way back to the stillness."<br/>- Yours truly</i></li>
